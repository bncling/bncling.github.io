      <description>Definition Let \(X\) be a set totally ordered by a relation \(\leq\). The order topology on \(X\) is the topology generated by the basis \(\B\) where \(\B\) is the collection of subsets of \(X\) of the form \(\{x \in X \mid x &amp;lt; a\}\), \(\{x \in X \mid a &amp;lt; x\}\), or \(\{x \in X \mid a &amp;lt; x &amp;lt; b\}\) for \(a, b \in X\).
Properties If \(X\) is a set totally ordered by a relation \(\leq\), then the order topology on \(X\) has a subbasis \(\Sub\) containing sets of the form \(\{x \in X \mid x &amp;lt; a\}\) or \(\{x \in X \mid a &amp;lt; x\}\).</description>

      <description>Sets have interesting closures.
Definition The unit square \([0,1] \times [0,1]\) is totally ordered by the lexicographic order, and the lexicographically ordered square is the topological space formed from the unit square together with the associated order topology.
Properties Many sets have very interesting, unexpected closures. See Exercise 3.21.
Separation Properties  \(T_1\)-space Hausdorff Regular and a \(T_3\)-space Normal and a \(T_4\)-space  These follow from the fact that this is a space with an order topology.</description>

      <description>Basically what the name makes it sound like. It’s similar in definition to the finite complement topology.
Definition Let \(X\) be a set. A set \(U\) is in the countable complement topology if and only if \(X - U\) is countable or if \(U = \emptyset\). This topology is also called the cocountable topology.
Properties Countable sets are closed in this topology.

      <description>The coarsest possible topology on a set \(X\).
Definition Let \(X\) be a set. The indiscrete topology is \(\mathcal{T} = \{\emptyset, X\}\). The topological space \((X, \{\emptyset, X\})\) is called an indiscrete space.
Properties By definition, the only sets in the indiscrete topology that are open are \(X\) and \(\emptyset\), and these are also the only closed sets.

      <description>Denoted \(\Rh\) in the textbook I’ve been using, the K-topology is a topology on \(\mathbb{R}\).
Definition Let \(K = \{1/n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) be the harmonic sequence. The K-topology on \(\mathbb{R}\) is generated by the basis containing sets of the form \((a,b)\) and sets of the form \((a,b) - K\) where \(a, b \in \mathbb{R}\) with \(a &amp;lt; b\).
Properties \(\Rh\) is finer than the standard topology.

Properties Theorem 4.9: A space \((X, \T)\) is normal if and only if for every closed set \(A \subset X\) and open set \(U\) containing \(A\), there exists an open set \(V\) such that \(A \subset V\) and \(\overline{V} \subset U\).</description>

      <description>The discrete topology is the finest topology on a given set. A set together with the discrete topology is called a discrete space.
Definition Let \(X\) be a set. Then the discrete topology on \(X\) contains all subsets of \(X\), that is, the topology is \(\mathcal{T} = 2^X\), the power set of \(X\).
Properties If \((X, \mathcal{T})\) is a topological space, then it is a discrete space if and only if all singletons are open.</description>

      <description>Much like in other areas, a subspace is a subset that still has extra structure.
Definition Let \((X, \T)\) be a topological space and let \(Y\) be a subset of \(X\). The collection \[\T_Y = \{ U \mid U = V \cap Y \text{ for some } V \in \T \}\] is a topology on \(Y\) called the subspace topology or the relative topology on \(Y\) inherited from \(X\). The space \((Y, \T_Y)\) is called a (topological) subspace of \((X, \T)\).</description>

      <description>Another, weirder topology on an infinite product.
Definition Let \(\{(X_\alpha, \T_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}\) be a (possibly infinite) collection of topological spaces. The box topology on the product \(\prod_{\alpha \in \lambda} X_\alpha\) is the topology generated by a basis consisting of sets of the form \(\prod_{\alpha \in \lambda} U_\alpha\) where \(U_\alpha\) is open in \((X_\alpha, \T_\alpha)\) for each \(\alpha\).
Properties As a consequence of Theorem 3.27, if the collection \(\{(X_\alpha, \T_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}\) is finite, the box topology on \(\prod_{\alpha \in \lambda} X_\alpha\) is the same as the product topology.</description>

      <description>Definitely review the page on infinite cartesian products for this one.
Definition Let \(\{(X_\alpha, \T_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}\) be a collection of topological spaces. We can define a topology on the product \(\prod_{\alpha \in \lambda} X_\alpha\) generated by the subbasis consisting of sets of the form \(\pi_\beta\inv (U_\beta)\) where \(\pi_\beta\) is a projection function, \(\beta \in \lambda\), and \(U_\beta\) is open in the space \((X_\beta, \T_\beta)\). We call this topology the product topology.</description>

      <description>Similar to the ideas behind bases in other areas of math.
Definition Let \((X, \T)\) be a topological space and let \(\B \subset \T\). \(\B\) is a basis for the topology \(\T\) if and only if every open set is the union of elements of \(\B\).
If \(\mathcal{B}\) is a basis, we call \(B \in \B\) a basic open set.

      <description>Definition For a set \(A\) in a topological space \((X, \mathcal{T})\), the boundary of \(A\), denoted \(\partial A\) or Bd\((A)\), is the intersection of the closures of \(A\) and its complement, that is, the set \(\partial A = \overline{X} \cap \overline{X - A}\).
Properties Theorem 2.28: If \(A\) is a set in a topological space \((X, \mathcal{T})\), the interior of \(A\), the boundary of \(A\), and the interior of the complement of \(A\) are disjoint sets whose union is \(X\).</description>

      <description>DeMorgan’s Laws relate complements of unions and intersections.
Statement Let \(X\) be a set and let \(\lbrace A_\alpha \rbrace_{\alpha \in \lambda}\) be a collection of subsets of \(X\). Then \[X - \left( \bigcup_{\alpha \in \lambda} A_\alpha \right) = \bigcap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X - A_\alpha)\] and \[X - \left( \bigcap_{\alpha \in \lambda} A_\alpha \right) = \bigcup_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X - A_\alpha).\]
Proof The proof here is for a weaker version of the laws for a finite collection of sets, written as an exercise for my topology work.</description>

      <description>Given two topologies on a set \(X\), we can compare them with the notions of fineness and coarseness. You can think about the fineness of a topology determining the amount you can see (you “see” the open sets) when looking at the set \(X\). If a topology is very fine, you can see a lot of open sets, but if the topology is very coarse, things are “blurry” because there are few open sets.</description>

Definition Let \((X, \mathcal{T})\) be a topological space and let \(A\) be a subset of \(X\). The interior of \(A\), denoted \(A^\circ\) or Int\((A)\), is the largest open set contained entirely within \(A\), that is, the set \[A^\circ = \bigcup_{U \subset A, \, U \in \mathcal{T}} U.\]

The \(\varepsilon\)-\(\delta\) definition of a limit (and variants) Let \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) be a function and let \(a,L \in \mathbb{R}\).
 \(\lim \limits_{x \to a} f(x) = L\) if and only if for every \(\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0\), there exists a \(\delta &amp;gt; 0\) such that \(0 &amp;lt; \vert x - a \vert &amp;lt; \delta\) implies that \(\vert f(x) - L \vert &amp;lt; \varepsilon\).</description>

Properties of closed sets  Theorem 2.14: A set \(A\) is closed if and only if its complement \(X - A\) is open. If \(\lbrace A_\alpha \rbrace_{\alpha \in \lambda}\) is a collection of closed sets, then \(\bigcap_{\alpha \in \lambda} A_\alpha\) is closed, but \(\bigcup_{\alpha \in \lambda} A_\alpha\) need not be closed.</description>

Types of discontinuities Let \(f: \mathcal{D} \to \mathbb{R}\) be a function and \(c \in \mathcal{D}\). Then

Properties If \(p\) is an isolated point of a set \(A\) in a topological space \((X, \mathcal{T})\), then there exists an open set \(U\) such that \(U \cap A = \{p\}\).
Examples In the topological space defined by \(X = \{a,b,c,d\}\) and \(\mathcal{T} = \{\emptyset, X, \{a\},\{a,b\}\}\), the point \(b\) is in the set \(A = \{b,c\}\), but is not a limit point of \(A\) since \(\{a,b\}\) is open but \((\{a,b\} - \{b\}) \cap A = \emptyset\).</description>

      <description>A topology on a set is a way of determining which subsets are open, closed, neither, or both. Elements of open sets can be thought of as being “close” in a way that isn’t dependent on notions of distance. If \(X\) is a set and \(\mathcal{T}\) is a topology on \(X\), then we call \((X, \mathcal{T})\) a topological space.
Definition Let \(X\) be a set. Then \(\mathcal{T}\) is a topology on \(X\) if and only if \(\mathcal{T}\) is a collection of subsets of \(X\) such that:</description>
