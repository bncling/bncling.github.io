      <description>Definition The \(n\)th Bell number, denoted \(B_n\) is the total number of ways of partitioning the set \([n]\).
Properties The Bell numbers are given by the formula \[B_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \stirlingII{n}{k}\] where \(\stirlingII{n}{k}\) is the Stirling number of the second kind which counts the number of ways to partition \([n]\) into \(k\) nonempty parts.
Theorem: For \(n \geq 1\), the bell numbers satisfy the recursion \[B_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k} B_k.\]</description>

      <description>Definitions Let \((G, \cdot)\) be a group with a subgroup \(H\). We say that elements \(a, b \in G\) are left-equivalent, written \(a \sim_L b\), if and only if \(a\inv b \in H\). Similarly, we say they are right-equivalent, written \(a \sim_R b\), if and only if \(ab\inv \in H\). Then \(\sim_L\) and \(\sim_R\) are relations on \(G\), and we have that
 \(a\inv a = e \in H &amp;lt; G\), meaning \(a \sim_L a\) for all \(a \in G\), \(a \sim_L b\) means \(a\inv b \in H \implies b\inv a = (a\inv b)\inv \in H &amp;lt; G \implies b \sim_L a\) for all \(a,b \in G\), and \(a \sim_L b\) and \(b \sim_L c\) means \(a\inv c = (a\inv b) (b \inv c) \in H &amp;lt; G \implies a \sim_L c\) for all \(a,b,c \in G\),  which means \(\sim_L\) is an equivalence relation on \(G\).</description>

      <description>Definitions A relation \(R\) on a set \(S\) is called an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. When \((a,b) \in R\), we write \(a \sim b\).
The equivalence class of an element \(a \in S\) with equivalence relation \(R\) is the set \([a] := \{b \in S \mid a \sim b\}\) of elements equivalent to \(a\).
Properties The equivalence classes of a relation \(R\) partition the set \(S\).</description>

      <description>Also called maps.
Definitions A function \(f: \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{C}\) is a set of ordered pairs \((a,b)\) where \(a \in \mathcal{D}\) and \(b \in \mathcal{C}\) with the property that if \((a,b) \in f\) and \((a,c) \in f\), then \(b=c\). If \((a,b) \in f\), we write \(f(a)=b\).
We call the set \(\mathcal{D}\) the domain of \(f\) and the set \(\mathcal{C}\) the codomain of \(f\).
We call the set \(\{f(x) \mid x \in \mathcal{D}\}\) the image of \(f\), denoted \(\im (f)\).</description>

      <description>The First Isomorphism Theorem Let \(G\) and \(H\) be groups and let \(\varphi: G \to H\) be a homomorphism with kernel \(K\). Let \(\pi: G \to G/K\) be the canonical homomorphism from the group \(G\) to the quotient group \(G/K\). Then there is a unique isomorphism \(\tilde\varphi: G/K \to \im(G)\) such that \(\varphi = \tilde\varphi \circ \pi\). We have the following diagram:   Corollary: If \(\varphi\) is surjective, then \(G/K \cong H\).</description>

      <description>Definition An integer partition of the number \(n\) into \(k\) parts is a writing of \(n\) as a sum of \(k\) positive integers \(n = a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_k\) where \(a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \dots \geq a_k \geq 1\).
Properties The number of ways to partition the number \(n\) into \(k\) positive parts is given by the stirling number of the first kind, \(\stirlingI{n}{k}\).

      <description>Definition Noncrossing partitions of \([n]\) are partitions of \([n]\) into parts \(\{B_1, \dots, B_k\}\) such that if \(a &amp;lt; b &amp;lt; c &amp;lt; d\) are elements of \([n]\) with \(a,c \in B_i\) and \(b,d \in B_j\), then \(i = j\). Otherwise, a partition is crossing.
Properties Noncrossing partitions of \([n]\) can be visually represented as a series of \(n\) labeled dots with partitions represented by arcs connecting the dots that belong to a given part.</description>

      <description>Definition A permutation matrix of size \(n\) is a \(0/1\) matrix with entries all \(0\) except for a single \(1\) in each row and each column.
Given a permutation \(\sigma\) on \([n]\), its associated permutation matrix \(A_\sigma\) is a \(0/1\) matrix in which the \(j\)th column is all \(0\) aside from a single \(1\) in the \(\sigma(j)\)th row.
Properties The set of all permutation matrices of size \(n\) forms a group isomorphic to \(S_n\), the symmetric group on \(n\) symbols.</description>

      <description>Definitions A permutation on a set \(X\) is a bijection \(\sigma: X \to X\). The set of all permutations on the set \([n]\) is a group under composition and is called the symmetric group on \(n\) symbols.
A fixed point of a permutation \(\sigma\) is an element \(i \in X\) such that \(\sigma(i) = i\).

      <description>Also called factor groups.
Definition Let \((G, \cdot)\) be a group with normal subgroup \(N\). Then its corresponding quotient group, denoted \(G/N\), is the set of all left cosets of \(G\) (though \(N \triangleleft G\) means these are the same as the right cosets) together with group operation \(\cdot: G/N \times G/N\) given as follows. If \(aN, bN \in G/N\), then \(aN \cdot bN = (ab) N\).

      <description>Building blocks.
Definition A group \((G, \cdot)\) is simple if and only if it has no nontrivial proper normal subgroups.
Properties If \(G\) is a simple group that is not abelian, then \(G\) is not solvable.
Examples The only abelian simple groups are the cyclic groups of prime order, isomorphic to \(\Z_p\) for a prime \(p\).

      <description>Definitions The Stirling numbers of the first kind, denoted \(\stirlingI{n}{k}\), count the number of ways integers \(n\) can be partitioned into \(k\) pieces, each of which is greater than or equal to one. The Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted \(\stirlingII{n}{k}\), count the number of ways sets \([n]\) can be partitioned into \(k\) nonempty parts.
Properties The Stirling numbers of the first kind satisfy the following recursion: \[\stirlingI{n}{k} = \stirlingI{n-k}{k} + \stirlingI{n-1}{k-1},\] and we also have the following: \[\begin{align*} &amp;amp;\stirlingI{n}{n} = 1 \\ &amp;amp;\stirlingI{n}{0} = 0 \quad n \geq 1 \\ &amp;amp;\stirlingI{n}{k} = 0 \quad k &amp;gt; n \\ &amp;amp;\stirlingI{n}{n-1} = 1 \\ &amp;amp;\stirlingI{n}{1} = 1 \\ &amp;amp;\stirlingI{n}{n-2} = 2 \\ &amp;amp;\stirlingI{n}{2} = \bigg \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \bigg \rfloor.</description>

      <description>Symmetries of a polygon.
Definition The dihedral group \(D_n\) is the group of symmetries of a regular \(n\)-gon. The elements of the group are the rigid motions that act on the \(n\)-gon with barycenter at the origin, together with composition as the group operation.
Properties The group contains \(n\) rotations (counting the identity as a rotation by \(0\) radians), written as \(r^j\) for \(0 \leq j &amp;lt; n\) and \(n\) reflections, all of which have order \(2\) and can be written as \(sr^j\) for a given reflection \(s\).</description>

      <description>Groups that commute.
Definition A group \((G, \cdot)\) is abelian if the group operation is commutative. That is, if \(a \cdot b = b \cdot a\) for all \(a,b \in G\).
Properties In an abelian group, we have that \((ab)^n = a^n b^n\) for all \(a,b \in G\) and \(n \in \Z\).
If \(G\) is abelian, then its center is the entire group \(G\), and every subgroup is normal.
If the quotient group \(G/Z(G)\) is cyclic, then \(G\) is abelian.</description>

      <description>Definitions Let \((G, \cdot)\) be a group with a subgroup \(H\). The centralizer of the subgroup \(H\) in \(G\), denoted \(C(H)\), is the set of elements of \(G\) that commute with all elements of \(H\). That is, \(C(H) = \{g \in G \mid gh = hg \,\, \forall h \in H\}\). For an element \(x \in G\), the centralizer of the element \(x\) in \(G\), denoted \(C(x)\) is the set of elements of \(G\) that commute with the element \(x\).</description>

      <description>Definition An automorphism of a group \((G, \cdot)\) is a map \(f: G \to G\) that is an ismorphism.
An inner automorphism of \(G\) is an automorphism \(i_g: G \to G\) given by conjugation: \(i_g (x) = gxg\inv\).
Properties Because automorphisms are bijections from the set \(G\) to itself, the set of all automorphisms, denoted \(\Aut (G)\), is a subset of \(\Sym(G)\), the symmetric group on \(G\). In fact, \(\Aut(G)\) is a subgroup of \(\Sym(G)\).</description>

      <description>Definitions Let \((G, \cdot)\) and \((H, \circ)\) be groups. A map \(\varphi: G \to H\) is called a group homomorphism if it preserves the group operation. That is, \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism if and only if for all \(a,b \in G\) we have \(\varphi(a \cdot b) = \varphi(a) \circ \varphi(b)\).
If a homomorphism \(\varphi\) is called a monomorphism if it is injective, an epimorphism if it is surjective, and an isomorphism if it is bijective.</description>

\(H\) and \(K\) are normal in \(G\) (\(H, K \triangleleft G\)), \(H\) and \(K\) intersect trivially (\(H \cap K = \{e\}\)), \(G\) is the set \(HK = \{hk \mid h \in H, k \in K\}\).  Properties Lemma: If \(H,K \triangleleft G\) and \(H \cap K = \{e\}\), then for all \(h \in H\) and \(k \in K\), \(hk = kh\), that is, elements in \(H\) commute with elements in \(K\).</description>

      <description>Statement Let \((G, \cdot)\) be a finite group and let \(H\) be a subgroup of \(G\). Then \(\vert G \vert = [G:H] \vert H \vert\), and therefore the order of \(H\) divides the order of \(G\).
Proof Since the cosets of \(H\) in \(G\) partition \(G\) into \([G:H]\) disjoint subsets, all of which have the same size, we have that \[G = \bigsqcup_{\text{distinct cosets } H_i} H_i \implies \vert G \vert = \sum_{\text{distinct cosets } H_i} \vert H_i \vert = [G:H] \vert H \vert.</description>

Properties Proposition: The following are equivalent.
 \(H \triangleleft G\); \(gH = Hg\) for all \(g \in G\); \(gHg\inv = H\) for all \(g \in G\); \(gHg\inv \subset H\) for all \(g \in G\).</description>

      <description>Definition The alternating group, denoted \(A_n\), is the normal subgroup of \(S_n\) containing all even permutations.
Properties The group has order \(n! / 2\). It is not abelian or cyclic for \(n \geq 4\), and it is simple for \(n \geq 5\).
Because \([S_n:A_n] = 2\), \(A_n\) is normal in \(S_n\).
Examples The group \(A_4\) has order \(12\) but has no subgroups of order \(6\). This is because if \(H\) is a subgroup of order \(6\), it contains at least two \(3\)-cycles because \(A_4\) contains all eight \(3\)-cycles (since all odd-length cycles are even).</description>

      <description>Definitions A group \((G, \cdot)\) is a cyclic group if there exists an element \(a \in G\) such that every element of \(G\) can be written as \(a^k\) for some \(k \in \Z\). In this case, we write \(G = \langle a \rangle := \{a^k \mid k \in \Z \}\).
Properties All cyclic groups are abelian.
If \(G\) is an infinite cyclic group, then it is isomorphic to the integers, \((\Z, +)\), and if it is a finite cyclic group, then it is isomorphic to \(\Z_n\), the group of equivalence classes mod \(n\) where \(n = \vert G \vert\) is the order of the group.</description>

      <description>Definitions Let \((G, \cdot)\) and \((H, \circ)\) be groups. The external direct product of \(G\) and \(H\), is the set \(G \times H\), the cartesian product of \(G\) and \(H\) as sets, together with a group operation given by performing the group operations of \(G\) and \(H\) component-wise. That is, \((g_1,h_1) (g_2,h_2) = (g_1 \cdot g_2, h_1 \circ h_2)\) for elements \(g_1,g_2 \in G\) and \(h_1, h_2 \in H\).
For an arbitrary collection of groups \(\{(G_\alpha, \circ_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}\), the external direct product is defined analogously as the set \(G = \prod_{\alpha \in \lambda} G_\alpha\) together with the group operation \(\circ\) defined so that if \(x,y \in G\), then the projections satisfy \(\pi_\beta (x \circ y) = \pi_\beta(x) \circ_\beta \pi_\beta(y)\) for all \(\beta \in \lambda\).</description>

      <description>Definition Let \((G, \cdot)\) be a group. The center of \(G\) is the set \(\{x \in G \mid gx = xg \,\, \forall g \in G\}\), denoted \(Z(G)\), of elements in \(G\) that commute with all other elements.
Properties If \(G\) is an abelian group, then \(Z(G) = G\).
The center of \(G\) is always a normal subgroup of \(G\).
Examples The center of \(D_n\) is trivial if \(n\) is odd, and equal to \(\{e,r^{n/2}\}\) if \(n\) is even.</description>

      <description>The symmetries of something.
Definitions A group \((G, \cdot)\) is a set \(G\) together with a binary operation \(\cdot: G \times G \to G\) such that
 The group operation is associative: \((ab)c = a(bc)\) for all \(a,b,c \in G\); \(G\) has an identity element: there exists \(e \in G\) such that \(ae = a = ea\) for all \(a \in G\); Every element is invertible: for all \(a \in G\), there exists a \(b \in G\) such that \(ab = e = ba\).</description>

      <description>Definition Let \((G, \cdot)\) be a group and let \(g \in G\). The order of \(g\), denoted \(\vert g \vert\) is the smallest positive integer \(n\) such that \(g^n = e\), the identity element of \(G\). If such an \(n\) exists, \(g\) has finite order. Otherwise, \(g\) has infinite order.
Properties By Lagrange’s Theorem, the order of \(g\) always divides the order of the group, \(\vert G \vert\).
If \(g^m = e\), then the order of \(g\) divides \(m\).</description>

Definition Let \(T \in \Lin(V,W)\) be a linear map between vector spaces \(V\) and \(W\). The range of \(T\), denoted \(\range T\), is the subset of \(W\) containing vectors of the form \(Tv\) for some \(v \in V\), that is, \[\range T = \{Tv \mid v \in V\}.\]
Properties (3.19) Proposition: If \(T \in \Lin(V,W)\), then \(\range T\) is a subspace of \(W\).
(3.22) Fundamental Theorem of Linear Maps: If \(V\) is a finite-dimensional vector space and \(T \in \Lin(V,W)\) is a linear map, then \[\dim V = \dim \, \nl T + \dim \, \range T,\] where \(\nl T\) denotes the null space of \(T\) and \(\dim V\) is the dimension of the space \(V\).</description>

      <description>Sometimes denoted \(\Z_n^\times\).
Definition The group of units mod \(n\), denoted \(U(n)\), is a finite group formed by removing the non-invertible elements of \(\Z_n\) (which are equivalence classes) under multiplication.
Properties The group of units is an abelian group since multiplcation of equivalence classes is commutative.
The group of units mod \(n\) is not always cyclic in general, but if \(n\) is \(2\), \(4\), \(p^k\), or \(2p^k\) for a prime \(p\) and natural number \(k\), then it is cyclic becuase the group has a generator.</description>

Properties The group is abelian.
Every non-identity element has order \(2\).
Examples The group can also be thought of as being given by the group presentation \(\langle a,b \mid a^2, b^2, (ab)^2 \rangle\).
Alternatively, the group can be thought of as the subgroup of the general linear group \(GL_2(\R)\) given by \[V = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; -1 \end{pmatrix} \right\}.</description>

      <description>Definition Let \(V\) be a vector space with basis \((v_1, \dots, v_n)\). We define the dual basis to be the list \((\varphi_1, \dots, \varphi_n)\) of linear functionals on \(V\) such that \[\varphi_j(v_k) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp;amp; k=j \\ 0 &amp;amp; k \neq j \end{cases},\] that is, \(\varphi_j\) is the linear map from \(V\) to \(\F\) assigning \(1\) to the \(j\)th basis vector of \(V\) and \(0\) to all other basis vectors.</description>

      <description>Definitions Let \(V\) be a vector space over \(\F\). A linear functional on \(V\) is a linear map \(T \in \Lin(V, \F)\). We call \(V&amp;#39; = \Lin(V, \F)\) the dual space of \(V\), the vector space of all linear functionals on \(V\).
Properties We have that \(\dim V&amp;#39; = \dim (\Lin (V, \F)) = (\dim V) (\dim \F) = \dim V\).
Examples Let \(V = \Poly (\R)\). Then \(V&amp;#39;\) is the space of all linear maps from \(\Poly (\R)\) to \(\R\).</description>

      <description>Definition Let \(U_1, \dots, U_m\) be subspaces of a vector space \(V\). If each element \(u \in U_1 + \dots + U_m\) can be written uniquely as a sum \(u_1 + \dots + u_m\) where each \(u_i \in U_i\), then this sum is called a direct sum. In this case, we write the sum as \(U_1 \oplus \dots \oplus U_m\).

Definition A linear map from a vector space \(V\) to a vector space \(W\) is a function \(T: V \to W\) with the following properties:
 additivity: \(T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v)\) for all \(u,v \in V\); homogeneity: \(T(av) = aT(v)\) for all \(v \in V\) and \(a \in \F\).  We denote the set of all linear maps from \(V\) to \(W\) by \(\Lin (V, W)\).</description>

      <description>Guess what? They are also vector spaces.
Definition Let \(V_1, \dots, V_n\) be vector spaces over \(\F\). The product of these spaces, denoted \(V_1 \times \dots \times V_n\) is the set \[\{(v_1, \dots, v_n) \mid v_1 \in V_1, \dots, v_n \in V_n\}.\] (This is the same way we define finite cartesian products.)
Properties We define addition and scalar multiplication on \(V_1 \times \dots \times V_n\) as follows: \[\begin{gather*} (a_1, \dots, a_n) + (b_1, \dots, b_n) = (a_1 + b_1, \dots, a_n + b_n); \\ c (a_1, \dots, a_n) = (ca_1, \dots, ca_n).</description>

      <description>Definitions Let \(V\) and \(W\) be vector spaces. A linear map \(T \in \Lin (V, W)\) is called invertible if there exists a map \(S \in \Lin(W, V)\) such that the products \(ST\) and \(TS\) are the identity maps on \(V\) and \(W\), respectively.
We call the map \(S\) the inverse of \(T\), denoted \(T\inv\) (see the uniqueness property below).
An invertible linear map \(T \in \Lin(V, W)\) is called an isomorphism, and the spaces \(V\) and \(W\) are called isomorphic to one another.</description>

      <description>Definition Let \(V\) be a vector space. A basis of \(V\) is a list of vectors in \(V\) that is linearly independent and spans \(V\).
Properties (2.29) Proposition: A list \((v_1, \dots, v_n)\) is a basis of \(V\) if and only if every \(v \in V\) can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of \((v_1, \dots, v_n)\).

      <description>Definition The dimension of a finite dimensional vector space \(V\), denoted \(\dim V\), is the length of any basis of \(V\).
Properties (2.43) Theorem: If \(U_1\) and \(U_2\) are subspaces of a vector space \(V\), then their sum satisfies \[\dim (U_1 + U_2) = \dim U_1 + \dim U_2 - \dim (U_1 \cap U_2).\]
(3.22) Fundamental Theorem of Linear Maps: If \(V\) is a finite-dimensional vector space and \(T \in \Lin(V,W)\) is a linear map, then \[\dim V = \dim \, \nl T + \dim \, \range T,\] where \(\nl T\) and \(\range T\) denote the null space and range of \(T\), respectively.</description>

      <description>Definitions A list of vectors \((v_1, \dots, v_n)\) in a vector space \(V\) is linearly independent if and only if \(a_1 v_1 + \dots + a_n v_n = 0\) implies that \(a_1 = \dots = a_n = 0\).
The list is linearly dependent if and only if it is not linearly independent.

      <description>Definition Let \(U\), \(V\), and \(W\) be vector spaces. If \(T \in \Lin(U, V)\) and \(S \in \Lin(V, W)\) are linear maps such that \(T\) maps \(U\) into the domain of \(S\), then we define the product \(ST \in \Lin(U, W)\) by \((ST)v = S(Tv)\), that is, \(ST\) is the composition \(S \circ T\) of the two maps.
Properties Associativity. If \(T_1\), \(T_2\), and \(T_3\) are linear maps such that \(T_3\) maps into the domain of \(T_2\) which in turn maps into the domain of \(T_1\), then \((T_1 T_2) T_3 = T_1 (T_2 T_3)\).</description>

      <description>Definition Let \(V\) be a vector space. A subset \(U\) of \(V\) is a subspace of \(V\) if and only if it is also a vector space.
Properties Since many properties of the vector space \(V\) are inherited, a subset \(U\) is a subspace provided it satisfies the following:
 additive identity: \(0 \in U\); closed under addition: \(u,v \in U\) implies \(u + v \in U\); closed under scalar multiplication: \(a \in \F\), \(v \in V\) implies \(av \in U\).</description>

Definition Let \(\mathbb{H} = \{(x,y) \mid x,y \in \mathbb{R}, y \geq 0\}\). The Moore plane is this set with the topology generated by the basis containing - all balls of the form \(B((x,y), r)\) where \(0&amp;lt;r \leq y\), and - all balls of the form \(B((x,y),r) \cup \{(x,0)\}\) where \(r = y &amp;gt; 0\).</description>

Definition Let \(\{(X_\alpha, \T_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}\) be a collection of topological spaces. We can define a topology on the product \(\prod_{\alpha \in \lambda} X_\alpha\) generated by the subbasis consisting of sets of the form \(\pi_\beta\inv (U_\beta)\) where \(\pi_\beta\) is a projection function, \(\beta \in \lambda\), and \(U_\beta\) is open in the space \((X_\beta, \T_\beta)\).

      <description>A topology on a set is a way of determining which subsets are open, closed, neither, or both. Elements of open sets can be thought of as being “close” in a way that isn’t dependent on notions of distance. If \(X\) is a set and \(\mathcal{T}\) is a topology on \(X\), then we call \((X, \mathcal{T})\) a topological space.
Definition Let \(X\) be a set. Then \(\mathcal{T}\) is a topology on \(X\) if and only if \(\mathcal{T}\) is a collection of subsets of \(X\) such that:</description>

      <description>Given two topologies on a set \(X\), we can compare them with the notions of fineness and coarseness. You can think about the fineness of a topology determining the amount you can see (you “see” the open sets) when looking at the set \(X\). If a topology is very fine, you can see a lot of open sets, but if the topology is very coarse, things are “blurry” because there are few open sets.</description>

      <description>Definition Let \((X, \T)\) be a topological space. It is normal if and only if for every pair of disjoint, closed sets \(A\) and \(B\), there are disjoint open sets \(U\) and \(V\) such that \(A \subset U\) and \(B \subset V\).
Properties Theorem 4.9: A space \((X, \T)\) is normal if and only if for every closed set \(A \subset X\) and open set \(U\) containing \(A\), there exists an open set \(V\) such that \(A \subset V\) and \(\overline{V} \subset U\).</description>

      <description>Definition Let \((X, \T)\) be a topological space. It is regular if and only if for every point \(x \in X\) and closed set \(A \subset X\) with \(x \notin A\), there exist disjoint open sets \(U\) and \(V\) such that \(x \in U\) and \(A \subset V\).
Properties Theorem 4.8: A space \((X, \T)\) is regular if and only if for each point \(p \in X\) and open set \(U\) with \(p \in U\), there exists an open set \(V\) such that \(p \in V\) and \(\overline{V} \subset U\) (where \(\overline{V}\) is the closure of \(V\) in \((X, \T)\)).</description>

      <description>The discrete topology is the finest topology on a given set. A set together with the discrete topology is called a discrete space.
Definition Let \(X\) be a set. Then the discrete topology on \(X\) contains all subsets of \(X\), that is, the topology is \(\mathcal{T} = 2^X\), the power set of \(X\).
Properties If \((X, \mathcal{T})\) is a topological space, then it is a discrete space if and only if all singletons are open.</description>

An element \((a,b)\) of \(A \times B\) can be projected back to the set \(A\) or \(B\) with the projection functions \(\pi_X : X \times Y \to X\) and \(\pi_Y : X \times Y \to Y\) defined as \(\pi_X (a,b) = a\) and \(\pi_Y (a,b) = b\).</description>

      <description>Another, weirder topology on an infinite product.
Definition Let \(\{(X_\alpha, \T_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}\) be a (possibly infinite) collection of topological spaces. The box topology on the product \(\prod_{\alpha \in \lambda} X_\alpha\) is the topology generated by a basis consisting of sets of the form \(\prod_{\alpha \in \lambda} U_\alpha\) where \(U_\alpha\) is open in \((X_\alpha, \T_\alpha)\) for each \(\alpha\).
Properties As a consequence of Theorem 3.27, if the collection \(\{(X_\alpha, \T_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}\) is finite, the box topology on \(\prod_{\alpha \in \lambda} X_\alpha\) is the same as the product topology.</description>

      <guid>https://bncling.github.io/math-wiki/boundary/</guid>
      <description>Definition For a set \(A\) in a topological space \((X, \mathcal{T})\), the boundary of \(A\), denoted \(\partial A\) or Bd\((A)\), is the intersection of the closures of \(A\) and its complement, that is, the set \(\partial A = \overline{X} \cap \overline{X - A}\).
Properties Theorem 2.28: If \(A\) is a set in a topological space \((X, \mathcal{T})\), the interior of \(A\), the boundary of \(A\), and the interior of the complement of \(A\) are disjoint sets whose union is \(X\).</description>

      <description>DeMorgan’s Laws relate complements of unions and intersections.
Statement Let \(X\) be a set and let \(\lbrace A_\alpha \rbrace_{\alpha \in \lambda}\) be a collection of subsets of \(X\). Then \[X - \left( \bigcup_{\alpha \in \lambda} A_\alpha \right) = \bigcap_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X - A_\alpha)\] and \[X - \left( \bigcap_{\alpha \in \lambda} A_\alpha \right) = \bigcup_{\alpha \in \lambda} (X - A_\alpha).\]
Proof The proof here is for a weaker version of the laws for a finite collection of sets, written as an exercise for my topology work.</description>

Definition Let \((X, \mathcal{T})\) be a topological space and let \(A\) be a subset of \(X\). The interior of \(A\), denoted \(A^\circ\) or Int\((A)\), is the largest open set contained entirely within \(A\), that is, the set \[A^\circ = \bigcup_{U \subset A, \, U \in \mathcal{T}} U.\]
Properties Theorem 2.26: A point \(p\) is an interior point of a set \(A\) in a topological space \((X, \mathcal{T})\) if and only if there exists an open set \(U\) with \(p \in U \subset A\).</description>

      <description>Intuitively, “\(\lim \limits_{x \to a} f(x) = L\)” means that the outputs of a function \(f\) approaches the value \(L\) as the inputs approach the value \(a\).
The \(\varepsilon\)-\(\delta\) definition of a limit (and variants) Let \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) be a function and let \(a,L \in \mathbb{R}\).
 \(\lim \limits_{x \to a} f(x) = L\) if and only if for every \(\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0\), there exists a \(\delta &amp;gt; 0\) such that \(0 &amp;lt; \vert x - a \vert &amp;lt; \delta\) implies that \(\vert f(x) - L \vert &amp;lt; \varepsilon\).</description>

      <description>Definition In a topological space \((X, \mathcal{T})\), a closed set \(A\) is a subset of \(X\) that is equal to its closure (\(\overline{A} = A\)). That is, \(A\) contains all its limit points.
Properties of closed sets  Theorem 2.14: A set \(A\) is closed if and only if its complement \(X - A\) is open. If \(\lbrace A_\alpha \rbrace_{\alpha \in \lambda}\) is a collection of closed sets, then \(\bigcap_{\alpha \in \lambda} A_\alpha\) is closed, but \(\bigcup_{\alpha \in \lambda} A_\alpha\) need not be closed.</description>

      <description>Definition A function \(f: \mathcal{D} \to \mathbb{R}\) is discontinuous at a point \(c \in \mathcal{D}\) if and only if \(f\) is not continuous at \(c\). That is, if the limit \(\lim \limits_{x \to c} f(x)\) does not exist or is not equal to \(f(c)\).
Types of discontinuities Let \(f: \mathcal{D} \to \mathbb{R}\) be a function and \(c \in \mathcal{D}\). Then
 \(f\) has an infinite discontinuity at \(c\) if and only if \(\lim \limits_{x \to c} f(x) = \pm \infty\).</description>

      <description>Definition Let \((X,\mathcal{T})\) be a topological space, \(A\) a subset of \(X\), and \(p \in A\) a point. We say \(p\) is an isolated point if it is not a limit point of \(A\).
Properties If \(p\) is an isolated point of a set \(A\) in a topological space \((X, \mathcal{T})\), then there exists an open set \(U\) such that \(U \cap A = \{p\}\).
Examples In the topological space defined by \(X = \{a,b,c,d\}\) and \(\mathcal{T} = \{\emptyset, X, \{a\},\{a,b\}\}\), the point \(b\) is in the set \(A = \{b,c\}\), but is not a limit point of \(A\) since \(\{a,b\}\) is open but \((\{a,b\} - \{b\}) \cap A = \emptyset\).</description>

      <description>Generalizing more things from calculus – this time the idea of a point being “arbitrarily close” to a set.
Definition Let \((X, \mathcal{T})\) be a topological space, let \(A \subset X\) be a subset, and let \(p \in X\) be a point. We say that \(p\) is a limit point of \(A\) if and only if for each open set \(U\) containing \(p\), \((U - \{p\}) \cap A \neq \emptyset\).</description>
