      <description>Definition An automorphism of a group \((G, \cdot)\) is a map \(f: G \to G\) that is an ismorphism.
An inner automorphism of \(G\) is an automorphism \(i_g: G \to G\) given by conjugation: \(i_g (x) = gxg\inv\).
Properties Because automorphisms are bijections from the set \(G\) to itself, the set of all automorphisms, denoted \(\Aut (G)\), is a subset of \(\Sym(G)\), the symmetric group on \(G\). In fact, \(\Aut(G)\) is a subgroup of \(\Sym(G)\).</description>

      <description>Definition Let \(G\) be a group with subgroups \(H\) and \(K\). We say that \(G\) is the internal direct product of \(H\) and \(K\) if and only if the follow three conditions hold:
\(H\) and \(K\) are normal in \(G\) (\(H, K \triangleleft G\)), \(H\) and \(K\) intersect trivially (\(H \cap K = \{e\}\)), \(G\) is the set \(HK = \{hk \mid h \in H, k \in K\}\).  Properties Lemma: If \(H,K \triangleleft G\) and \(H \cap K = \{e\}\), then for all \(h \in H\) and \(k \in K\), \(hk = kh\), that is, elements in \(H\) commute with elements in \(K\).</description>

      <description>Statement Let \((G, \cdot)\) be a finite group and let \(H\) be a subgroup of \(G\). Then \(\vert G \vert = [G:H] \vert H \vert\), and therefore the order of \(H\) divides the order of \(G\).
Proof Since the cosets of \(H\) in \(G\) partition \(G\) into \([G:H]\) disjoint subsets, all of which have the same size, we have that \[G = \bigsqcup_{\text{distinct cosets } H_i} H_i \implies \vert G \vert = \sum_{\text{distinct cosets } H_i} \vert H_i \vert = [G:H] \vert H \vert.</description>

      <title>The Alternating Group</title>

      <guid>https://bncling.github.io/math-wiki/alternating/</guid>
      <description>Definition The alternating group, denoted \(A_n\), is the normal subgroup of \(S_n\) containing all even permutations.
Properties The group has order \(n! / 2\). It is not abelian or cyclic for \(n \geq 4\), and it is simple for \(n \geq 5\).
Because \([S_n:A_n] = 2\), \(A_n\) is normal in \(S_n\).
Examples The group \(A_4\) has order \(12\) but has no subgroups of order \(6\). This is because if \(H\) is a subgroup of order \(6\), it contains at least two \(3\)-cycles because \(A_4\) contains all eight \(3\)-cycles (since all odd-length cycles are even).</description>

      <description>Definitions The symmetric group on a set \(X\) is the group of bijections \[\Sym(X) = \{f: X \to X \mid f \text{ is bijective}\}\] together with the group operation of composition of mappings.
The symmetric group on \(n\) symbols, denoted \(S_n\), is the symmetric group on the set \([n] := \{1, \dots, n\}\), the group of permutations.
Properties The group \(S_n\) is not cyclic or abelian for \(n \geq 3\).</description>

      <description>Groups that commute.
Definition A group \((G, \cdot)\) is abelian if the group operation is commutative. That is, if \(a \cdot b = b \cdot a\) for all \(a,b \in G\).
Properties In an abelian group, we have that \((ab)^n = a^n b^n\) for all \(a,b \in G\) and \(n \in \Z\).
If \(G\) is abelian, then its center is the entire group \(G\), and every subgroup is normal.
Examples The set of integers under addition, \((\Z, +)\), is an abelian group.</description>

      <guid>https://bncling.github.io/math-wiki/grp_cosets/</guid>
      <description>Definitions Let \((G, \cdot)\) be a group with a subgroup \(H\). We say that elements \(a, b \in G\) are left-equivalent, written \(a \sim_L b\), if and only if \(a\inv b \in H\). Similarly, we say they are right-equivalent, written \(a \sim_R b\), if and only if \(ab\inv \in H\). Then \(\sim_L\) and \(\sim_R\) are relations on \(G\), and we have that
 \(a\inv a = e \in H &amp;lt; G\), meaning \(a \sim_L a\) for all \(a \in G\), \(a \sim_L b\) means \(a\inv b \in H \implies b\inv a = (a\inv b)\inv \in H &amp;lt; G \implies b \sim_L a\) for all \(a,b \in G\), and \(a \sim_L b\) and \(b \sim_L c\) means \(a\inv c = (a\inv b) (b \inv c) \in H &amp;lt; G \implies a \sim_L c\) for all \(a,b,c \in G\),  which means \(\sim_L\) is an equivalence relation on \(G\).</description>

      <guid>https://bncling.github.io/math-wiki/cyclic/</guid>
      <description>Definitions A group \((G, \cdot)\) is a cyclic group if there exists an element \(a \in G\) such that every element of \(G\) can be written as \(a^k\) for some \(k \in \Z\). In this case, we write \(G = \langle a \rangle := \{a^k \mid k \in \Z \}\).
Properties All cyclic groups are abelian.
If \(G\) is an infinite cyclic group, then it is isomorphic to the integers, \((\Z, +)\), and if it is a finite cyclic group, then it is isomorphic to \(\Z_n\), the group of equivalence classes mod \(n\) where \(n = \vert G \vert\) is the order of the group.</description>

      <title>External Direct Products</title>

      <guid>https://bncling.github.io/math-wiki/grp_edp/</guid>
      <description>Definitions Let \((G, \cdot)\) and \((H, \circ)\) be groups. The external direct product of \(G\) and \(H\), is the set \(G \times H\), the cartesian product of \(G\) and \(H\) as sets, together with a group operation given by performing the group operations of \(G\) and \(H\) component-wise. That is, \((g_1,h_1) (g_2,h_2) = (g_1 \cdot g_2, h_1 \circ h_2)\) for elements \(g_1,g_2 \in G\) and \(h_1, h_2 \in H\).
For an arbitrary collection of groups \(\{(G_\alpha, \circ_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}\), the external direct product is defined analogously as the set \(G = \prod_{\alpha \in \lambda} G_\alpha\) together with the group operation \(\circ\) defined so that if \(x,y \in G\), then the projections satisfy \(\pi_\beta (x \circ y) = \pi_\beta(x) \circ_\beta \pi_\beta(y)\) for all \(\beta \in \lambda\).</description>

      <description>Definitions Let \((G, \cdot)\) and \((H, \circ)\) be groups. A map \(\varphi: G \to H\) is called a group homomorphism if it preserves the group operation. That is, \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism if and only if for all \(a,b \in G\) we have \(\varphi(a \cdot b) = \varphi(a) \circ \varphi(b)\).
If a homomorphism \(\varphi\) is called a monomorphism if it is injective, an epimorphism if it is surjective, and an isomorphism if it is bijective.</description>

      <description>Definition A subgroup \(H\) of a group \((G,\cdot)\) is said to be normal, written \(H \triangleleft G\), if and only if its left and right cosets are equal. That is, if and only if \(gH = Hg\) for all \(g \in G\).
Properties Proposition: The following are equivalent.
 \(H \triangleleft G\); \(gH = Hg\) for all \(g \in G\); \(gHg\inv = H\) for all \(g \in G\); \(gHg\inv \subset H\) for all \(g \in G\).</description>

      <guid>https://bncling.github.io/math-wiki/grp_center/</guid>
      <description>Definition Let \((G, \cdot)\) be a group. The center of \(G\) is the set \(\{x \in G \mid gx = xg \,\, \forall g \in G\}\), denoted \(Z(G)\), of elements in \(G\) that commute with all other elements.
Properties If \(G\) is an abelian group, then \(Z(G) = G\).
The center of \(G\) is always a normal subgroup of \(G\).
Examples The center of \(D_n\) is trivial if \(n\) is odd, and equal to \(\{e,r^{n/2}\}\) if \(n\) is even.</description>

      <description>Symmetries of a polygon.
Definition The dihedral group \(D_n\) is the group of symmetries of a regular \(n\)-gon. The elements of the group are the rigid motions that act on the \(n\)-gon with barycenter at the origin, together with composition as the group operation.
Properties The group contains \(n\) rotations (counting the identity as a rotation by \(0\) radians), written as \(r^j\) for \(0 \leq j &amp;lt; n\) and \(n\) reflections, all of which have order \(2\) and can be written as \(sr^j\) for a given reflection \(s\).</description>

      <description>The symmetries of something.
Definitions A group \((G, \cdot)\) is a set \(G\) together with a binary operation \(\cdot: G \times G \to G\) such that
 The group operation is associative: \((ab)c = a(bc)\) for all \(a,b,c \in G\); \(G\) has an identity element: there exists \(e \in G\) such that \(ae = a = ea\) for all \(a \in G\); Every element is invertible: for all \(a \in G\), there exists a \(b \in G\) such that \(ab = e = ba\).</description>

      <description>Definition Let \((G, \cdot)\) be a group and let \(g \in G\). The order of \(g\), denoted \(\vert g \vert\) is the smallest positive integer \(n\) such that \(g^n = e\), the identity element of \(G\). If such an \(n\) exists, \(g\) has finite order. Otherwise, \(g\) has infinite order.
Properties By Lagrange’s Theorem, the order of \(g\) always divides the order of the group, \(\vert G \vert\).
If \(g^m = e\), then the order of \(g\) divides \(m\).</description>

      <description>Definition A subgroup of a group \((G,\cdot)\) is a subset \(H \subset G\) such that \((H, \cdot)\) is a group under the same operation as \(G\). We write \(H &amp;lt; G\) if \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\).
Properties The sets \(\{e\}\) and \(G\) are subgroups of \(G\) for all groups \(G\). Subgroups that are not \(\{e\}\) are called nontrivial, and subgroups that are not \(G\) are called proper subgroups.</description>

      <description>Sometimes denoted \(\Z_n^\times\).
Definition The group of units mod \(n\), denoted \(U(n)\), is a finite group formed by removing the non-invertible elements of \(\Z_n\) (which are equivalence classes) under multiplication.
Properties The group of units is an abelian group since multiplcation of equivalence classes is commutative.
The group of units mod \(n\) is not always cyclic in general, but if \(n\) is \(2\), \(4\), \(p^k\), or \(2p^k\) for a prime \(p\) and natural number \(k\), then it is cyclic becuase the group has a generator.</description>

      <description>Definition The Klein four-group is a group that can be thought of in many ways, one of which is as the external direct product \(\Z_2 \times \Z_2\), and is typically denoted by \(V\).
Properties The group is abelian.
Every non-identity element has order \(2\).
Examples The group can also be thought of as being given by the group presentation \(\langle a,b \mid a^2, b^2, (ab)^2 \rangle\).
Alternatively, the group can be thought of as the subgroup of the general linear group \(GL_2(\R)\) given by \[V = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -1 &amp;amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;amp; -1 \end{pmatrix} \right\}.</description>
