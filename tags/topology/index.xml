      <description>Definition A topological space \((X, \T)\) is connected if and only if \(X\) cannot be written as the disjoint union of two nonempty open sets.
Properties Theorem 8.1 A space \(X\) being connected is equivalent to the following conditions:
 There does not exist a continuous function \(f: X \to \Rs\) such that \(f(X) = \{0,1\}\). \(X\) cannot be written as the disjoint union of two nonempty separated sets. \(X\) cannot be written as the disjoint union of two nonempty closed sets.</description>

The \(\varepsilon\)-\(\delta\), limit related definition A function \(f: \mathcal{D} \to \mathbb{R}\) is continuous at a point \(c \in \mathcal{D}\) if and only if the limit of \(f\) at \(c\) exists and \(\lim \limits_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)\). That is, for every \(\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0\), there exists a \(\delta &amp;gt; 0\) such that \(\vert x - c \vert &amp;lt; \delta\) implies \(\vert f(x) - f(c) \vert &amp;lt; \varepsilon\).</description>

      <description>Definition Let \((X, \T)\) be a topological space. Then the cone over \(X\) is the identification space \(X^*\) of the product \(X \times [0,1]\) where \[X^* = \{\{(x,t)\} \mid x \in X, t \in (0,1]\} \cup \{\{(x,0) \mid x \in X\}\}.\]
Examples If \(X\) is a compact subset of \(\R^n\) with the standard topology, then the cone over \(X\) is homeomorphic to the space \(C\) constructed in the following way: view \(\R^n\) as a subset of \(\R^{n+1}\), let \(x_0 \in \R^{n+1} - \R^n\), and define \(C\) to be the union of all line segments from \(x_0\) to points \(x \in X\).</description>

Properties Theorem 4.9: A space \((X, \T)\) is normal if and only if for every closed set \(A \subset X\) and open set \(U\) containing \(A\), there exists an open set \(V\) such that \(A \subset V\) and \(\overline{V} \subset U\).</description>

Given a surjective map \(f: X \to Y\) between topological spaces \(X\) and \(Y\), we call \(f\) a quotient map and \(Y\) a quotient space if and only if the topology on \(Y\) is the quotient topology with respect to \(Y\).</description>

      <description>Gluing two spaces together at a point.
Definition Let \(A\) and \(B\) be disjoint topological spaces with points \(p \in A\) and \(q \in B\). We define the wedge sum of \(A\) and \(B\) relative to the points \(p\) and \(q\), denoted \(A \vee B\) to be the quotient space \(A \cup B / p \sim q\).

      <description>Definitions Let \((X, \T)\) be a topological space and let \(X^*\) be a partition of \(X\). The identification map \(f: X \to X^*\) is the surjective map that takes each point of \(X\) to the part of the partition \(X^*\) containing it.
The identification space of \(X\) under the map \(f\) is the set \(X^*\) with a topology defined as follows: a set \(U \subset X^*\) is open in \(X^*\) if and only if the preimage \(f\inv(U)\) is open in \(X\).</description>

      <description>Another, weirder topology on an infinite product.
Definition Let \(\{(X_\alpha, \T_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}\) be a (possibly infinite) collection of topological spaces. The box topology on the product \(\prod_{\alpha \in \lambda} X_\alpha\) is the topology generated by a basis consisting of sets of the form \(\prod_{\alpha \in \lambda} U_\alpha\) where \(U_\alpha\) is open in \((X_\alpha, \T_\alpha)\) for each \(\alpha\).
Properties As a consequence of Theorem 3.27, if the collection \(\{(X_\alpha, \T_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}\) is finite, the box topology on \(\prod_{\alpha \in \lambda} X_\alpha\) is the same as the product topology.</description>

      <description>Definition Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces. A function \(f: X \to Y\) is called a homeomorphism if it is bijective and both \(f\) and \(f\inv\) are continuous. When there exists a homeomorphism \(f: X \to Y\), we say the two spaces \(X\) and \(Y\) are homeomorphic or that they are topologically equivalent.
Properties Theorem 7.26: Being homeomorphic is an equivalence relation on topological spaces.
Theorem 7.28: If \(f: X \to Y\) is a continuous bijection, then being open or closed is equivalent to being a homeomorphism.</description>

      <description>Definitely review the page on infinite cartesian products for this one.
Definition Let \(\{(X_\alpha, \T_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}\) be a collection of topological spaces. We can define a topology on the product \(\prod_{\alpha \in \lambda} X_\alpha\) generated by the subbasis consisting of sets of the form \(\pi_\beta\inv (U_\beta)\) where \(\pi_\beta\) is a projection function, \(\beta \in \lambda\), and \(U_\beta\) is open in the space \((X_\beta, \T_\beta)\). We call this topology the product topology.</description>

      <description>Definition Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces. A function \(f: X \to Y\) is an embedding if and only if the function \(f: X \to f(X)\) is a homeomorphism where \(f(X)\) has the relative topology from \(Y\).
Properties Corollary 7.31: Let \(X\) be compact and \(Y\) be Hausdorff. Then if \(f: X \to Y\) is an injective and continuous map, it is an embedding.</description>

Definition Let \((X, \T)\) be a topological space and let \(\B \subset \T\). \(\B\) is a basis for the topology \(\T\) if and only if every open set is the union of elements of \(\B\).
If \(\B\) is a basis, we call \(B \in \B\) a basic open set.

      <description>Definition A function \(f: X \to Y\) for topological spaces \(X\) and \(Y\) is called closed if and only for every closed set \(A \subset X\), the image \(f(A)\) is closed in \(Y\).

      <description>Definition A function \(f: X \to Y\) for topological spaces \(X\) and \(Y\) is called open if and only for every open set \(U \subset X\), the image \(f(U)\) is open in \(Y\).
Properties Theorem 7.22: If \(X\) has basis \(\{B_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}\) and \(f: X \to Y\) is continuous, surjective, and open, then \(Y\) has a basis \(\{f(B_\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in \lambda}\). This also means that if \(X\) is 2st countable, then so is \(Y\).</description>

      <description>A topology on a set is a way of determining which subsets are open, closed, neither, or both. Elements of open sets can be thought of as being “close” in a way that isn’t dependent on notions of distance. If \(X\) is a set and \(\mathcal{T}\) is a topology on \(X\), then we call \((X, \mathcal{T})\) a topological space.
Definition Let \(X\) be a set. Then \(\mathcal{T}\) is a topology on \(X\) if and only if \(\mathcal{T}\) is a collection of subsets of \(X\) such that:</description>

      <description>Denoted \(\Rh\) in the textbook I’ve been using, the K-topology is a topology on \(\mathbb{R}\).
Definition Let \(K = \{1/n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) be the harmonic sequence. The K-topology on \(\mathbb{R}\) is generated by the basis containing sets of the form \((a,b)\) and sets of the form \((a,b) - K\) where \(a, b \in \mathbb{R}\) with \(a &amp;lt; b\).
Properties \(\Rh\) is finer than the standard topology.

      <description>The discrete topology is the finest topology on a given set. A set together with the discrete topology is called a discrete space.
Definition Let \(X\) be a set. Then the discrete topology on \(X\) contains all subsets of \(X\), that is, the topology is \(\mathcal{T} = 2^X\), the power set of \(X\).
Properties If \((X, \mathcal{T})\) is a topological space, then it is a discrete space if and only if all singletons are open.</description>

      <description>Given two topologies on a set \(X\), we can compare them with the notions of fineness and coarseness. You can think about the fineness of a topology determining the amount you can see (you “see” the open sets) when looking at the set \(X\). If a topology is very fine, you can see a lot of open sets, but if the topology is very coarse, things are “blurry” because there are few open sets.</description>

      <description>Defintion A topological space \((X, \T)\) is separable if and only if \(X\) has a countable dense subset.
Properties Exercise 5.4: A space \((X, \T)\) being separable does not imply that all of its subspaces are separable.
Theorem 5.5: If two spaces \(X\) and \(Y\) are separable, then \(X \times Y\) with the product topology is separable.
Examples The space \(\Rs\) is separable, but \(\R\) with the discrete topology is not separable because the reals are uncountable and so for any countable subset, there is point not in the subset, and the set containing this point is open in the discrete topology, meaning not all open sets contain a point in the countable subset and so no countable subset can be dense.</description>

      <description>Definition For a set \(A\) in a topological space \((X, \mathcal{T})\), the boundary of \(A\), denoted \(\partial A\) or Bd\((A)\), is the intersection of the closures of \(A\) and its complement, that is, the set \(\partial A = \overline{X} \cap \overline{X - A}\).
Properties Theorem 2.28: If \(A\) is a set in a topological space \((X, \mathcal{T})\), the interior of \(A\), the boundary of \(A\), and the interior of the complement of \(A\) are disjoint sets whose union is \(X\).</description>

      <description>Points in the set and not on the boundary.
Definition Let \((X, \mathcal{T})\) be a topological space and let \(A\) be a subset of \(X\). The interior of \(A\), denoted \(A^\circ\) or Int\((A)\), is the largest open set contained entirely within \(A\), that is, the set \[A^\circ = \bigcup_{U \subset A, \, U \in \mathcal{T}} U.\]
Properties Theorem 2.26: A point \(p\) is an interior point of a set \(A\) in a topological space \((X, \mathcal{T})\) if and only if there exists an open set \(U\) with \(p \in U \subset A\).</description>

      <description>Intuitively, “\(\lim \limits_{x \to a} f(x) = L\)” means that the outputs of a function \(f\) approaches the value \(L\) as the inputs approach the value \(a\).
The \(\varepsilon\)-\(\delta\) definition of a limit (and variants) Let \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) be a function and let \(a,L \in \mathbb{R}\).
 \(\lim \limits_{x \to a} f(x) = L\) if and only if for every \(\varepsilon &amp;gt; 0\), there exists a \(\delta &amp;gt; 0\) such that \(0 &amp;lt; \vert x - a \vert &amp;lt; \delta\) implies that \(\vert f(x) - L \vert &amp;lt; \varepsilon\).</description>

      <description>Definition In a topological space \((X, \mathcal{T})\), a closed set \(A\) is a subset of \(X\) that is equal to its closure (\(\overline{A} = A\)). That is, \(A\) contains all its limit points.
Properties of closed sets  Theorem 2.14: A set \(A\) is closed if and only if its complement \(X - A\) is open. If \(\lbrace A_\alpha \rbrace_{\alpha \in \lambda}\) is a collection of closed sets, then \(\bigcap_{\alpha \in \lambda} A_\alpha\) is closed, but \(\bigcup_{\alpha \in \lambda} A_\alpha\) need not be closed.</description>

      <description>Definition Let \((X,\mathcal{T})\) be a topological space, \(A\) a subset of \(X\), and \(p \in A\) a point. We say \(p\) is an isolated point if it is not a limit point of \(A\).
Properties If \(p\) is an isolated point of a set \(A\) in a topological space \((X, \mathcal{T})\), then there exists an open set \(U\) such that \(U \cap A = \{p\}\).
Examples In the topological space defined by \(X = \{a,b,c,d\}\) and \(\mathcal{T} = \{\emptyset, X, \{a\},\{a,b\}\}\), the point \(b\) is in the set \(A = \{b,c\}\), but is not a limit point of \(A\) since \(\{a,b\}\) is open but \((\{a,b\} - \{b\}) \cap A = \emptyset\).</description>

      <description>Generalizing more things from calculus – this time the idea of a point being “arbitrarily close” to a set.
Definition Let \((X, \mathcal{T})\) be a topological space, let \(A \subset X\) be a subset, and let \(p \in X\) be a point. We say that \(p\) is a limit point of \(A\) if and only if for each open set \(U\) containing \(p\), \((U - \{p\}) \cap A \neq \emptyset\).</description>

      <description>Definition Define \(C_0\) to be the subset \(C_0 = [0,1]\) of \(\R\) with the standard topology. Define \(C_1\) to be \([0,1/3] \cup [2/3,1]\), that is, \(C_0\) with its middle third removed. Continue defining \(C_n\) be removing the middle thirds of each one of the disjoint closed intervals that make up \(C_{n-1}\). Then the Cantor set, denoted \(C\), is the intersection \[C = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty C_n.\]
Properties Exercise 7.42: The cantor set is homeomorphic to the product \(\prod_{n \in \N} \{0,1\}\) where each factor \(\{0,1\}\) has the discrete topology.</description>
