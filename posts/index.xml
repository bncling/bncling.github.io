      <description>In spaces where the base set \(X\) is not given, \(X\) is assumed to be uncountably infinite, and in the row for the product topology on \(X \times Y\), it is assumed that both \(X\) and \(Y\) have the property of interest. The labels 2nd and 1st are abbreviations for the countability properties.

      <description>The following is an assignment for a writing class aimed at a non-math audience.
Elliptic curves ​You might not have heard of elliptic curves before, but odds are you’ve used them without knowing it to securely pass information back and forth. Elliptic curves are abstract mathematical objects, and in the same way that you probably learned to represent equations like \(y = x^2\) or \(x^2 + y^2 = 4\) as curves in the \(xy\) plane in high school,​ we can graph elliptic curves.</description>
